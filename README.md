# AmenityReservationSystem
This is a fairly simple application to practice both backend and front end skills.
It will create a landing page hosted on a local machine that allows the user to login to a secured database to create reservations for different amenities.
The code mainly uses the Java Spring Boot framework along with Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, and Bootify frameworks to get up and running.
Currently, the only user that is authenticated is: <br>
> Username: briantran <br>
> Password: 12345

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ, `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

Update your local database connection in `application.yml` or create your own `application-local.yml` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For this, in IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing - [learn more](https://bootify.io/intellij/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

The application can then be started with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/amenity-reservation-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
